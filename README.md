# THIS REPOSITORY HAS MOVED

You can find it here: https://github.com/tatsuworks/gateway/tree/master/internal/state

I decided to merge gateway and state because they shared the same parsing
and foundationdb abtractions and it wasn't worth maintaining a separate
repo for just that. The repo history was merged into gateway and will
also be preserved here so you can see all the iterations it took to
arrive at the current solution :)
